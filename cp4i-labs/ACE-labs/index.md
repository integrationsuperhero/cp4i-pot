## Introduction
These labs will cover both the ACE Toolkit and ACE Designer to build integrations. We will be creating APIs with Designer and then also import them into APIC.   Will also cover labs on the Asset Repository and Operations Dashboard for tracing. 

## Lab Abstracts

|  Subject                            | Description                                            |                                                               
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 1](Lab_1/ReadMe.md)       | This is a basic toolkit lab that you will create a simple Ping flow and then test locally and deploy to the ACE runtime in CP4I. 
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 2](Lab_2/ReadMe.md)       | The purpose of this LAB is to show the configuration needed to distribute workloads using IBM App Connect Enterprise Callable Flows.
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 3](Lab_3/ReadMe.md)       | The purpose of this LAB is to show how to retrieve Salesforce Account Records using IBM App Connect Designer on IBM Cloud Pak for Integration. **Need to complete [Pre-Lab](Updated-Pre-Lab/Updated-Pre-Lab.md) before starting this Lab** 
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 4](Lab_4/ReadMe.md)       | This lab we will take the API created in lab 3 and expose it in IBM API connect.  APIC is an integrated API management offering, where all of the steps in the API lifecycle, and the actions that surround it, are performed within the offering.
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 5](Lab_5/ReadMe.md)       | The purpose of this LAB is to show how to retrieve ServiceNow User Records using IBM App Connect Designer on IBM Cloud Pak for Integration. **Need to complete [Pre-Lab](Updated-Pre-Lab/Updated-Pre-Lab.md) before starting this Lab** 
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 6](Lab_6/ReadMe.md)       | This lab we will take the API created in lab 5 and expose it in IBM API connect.  APIC is an integrated API management offering, where all of the steps in the API lifecycle, and the actions that surround it, are performed within the offering.
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 7](Lab_7/ReadMe.md)       |The purpose of this lab is to provide an introduction to the Asset Repository. The Asset Repository is an add-on to the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration that allows the user to store, manage, retrieve and search integration assets within the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and its capabilities.
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 8](Lab_8/ReadMe.md)       | The purpose of this lab is to provide an introduction to the Operations Dashboard. The IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Operations Dashboard Add-on provides cross-component transaction tracing to allow troubleshooting and investigating errors and latency issues across integration capabilities to ensure applications meet service level agreements.  This lab will leverage the integration capabilities of IBM API Connect, IBM App Connect Enterprise, and IBM MQ.
